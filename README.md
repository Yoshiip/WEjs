# WEjs
WEjs is an experimental graph editor allowing real-time graph modification.

> https://yoshiip.xyz/wejs

## Usage
Currently, there are two modes:
### Graph
- Draw the graph, adding/moving/deleting points.
- Add signage (stop, pedestrian crossing).

### OpenStreetMap
- Choose a location from a list, which will then be retrieved via the OpenStreetMap API. Some locations with many nodes may experience performance issues.

> In case of performance issues, you can tick the "Auto-Generate" checkbox, which generates the graph only after pressing the "Generate" button.

## Features
- Modify a graph using an intuitive editor
- 2D/3D rendering
- Decoration generation
- Add signage (stop, pedestrian crossing)
- Download locations using the OpenStreetMap API with Overpass Turbo.

## Plans
- Performance optimization
- More signage
- Automatic loading of locations using the OpenStreetMap API
